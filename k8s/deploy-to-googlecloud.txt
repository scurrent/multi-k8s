download and install the travis-cli - but it requires ruby to be installed on your local

lets get a docker image with Ruby pre-installed, then we can instsall travis cli in there


docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app ruby:2.3 sh           - download ruby ruby and run the shell
gem install travis --no-rdoc --no-ri                -ruby installer gem (alpine doesn't have gem)
gem install travis
travis login                            - use github username and password

- copy json file into the 'volumend' directory so we can use it in the container
travis encrypt-file service-account.json -r scurrent/multi-k8s

ls
cd app
ls inside app should see the copied in .json file
